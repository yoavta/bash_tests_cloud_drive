## how its work: 
1. Run the server with the port number.
2. Creating logs folder.
- _for each client:_
3. Open new tracking dir
3. Run client without a key. (Save log in logs)
4. Insert files to the client.
- _for each clone client:_
5. Open new tracking dir
6. Run client with the original client key. (Save log in logs)


## How to start:
- Go to terminal in __parent__ project directory. 


For example:
```bash
My project dir is : ~/university/net/ex2
The terminal should be on : ~/university/net
Like that : (yoavã‰¿kali-new)-[~/university/net]
```

- Clone tests
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yoavta/bash_tests_cloud_drive.git
```

- Open tests.sh and edit few things

Its all written in the script but you should edit:
1. Port number
2. Working directory
3. name of your project dir
```bash
FROM SCRIPT.SH:
#_________________________________________
# You need to change paths HERE: 

# 1) port number:
port=12475

# 2) directory until the \bash_tests_cloud_drive:
# need to look somthing like: dir=/home/name/university/networks/ex2/bash_tests_cloud_drive
dir=

# 3) name of the dir of your project
# need to look somthing like: project_name=server-client-ex2
project_name=
#_________________________________________
```
Dont forget to save.

- Run the script
```bash
sh script.sh
```
Test more things - deletion, etc'


- Restart

If you want to run again you should:
1. Kill all python proccess. 
```bash
sudo pgrep python3      # will show lists of python process
```

```bash
# the first one is the server, if you kill him all the process will die (lets say that is number is 12345)
sudo kil 12345
sudo pgrep python3     # to check that all the process die.
```
2. Change port.
3. And run again.
